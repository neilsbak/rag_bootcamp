The Fund aims to achieve this objective by investing primarily in equity securities, such as common stocks, of non-U.S. companies that are considered to be undervalued.

The fund uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis when evaluating ESG factors across seven major themes which include but are not limited to climate change, diversity and inclusion, and corporate governance. The fund's approach to ESG considerations is to actively seek out investments that have strong performance in these areas as well as taking a proactive role in engaging with companies that the fund invests in to encourage positive change and mitigate ESG-related risks.\n",

These tools offer financial leverage and the ability to hedge investments against adverse movements in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and movements in the securities markets. \n",
