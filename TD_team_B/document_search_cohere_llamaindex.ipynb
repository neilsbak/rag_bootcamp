The fund aims to capture these opportunities by adjusting weightings of specific equity securities while managing incremental risk. It is not clear whether ESG factors are considered within the scope of this quantitative analysis. Therefore, it is difficult to infer the fund's specific approach to incorporating ESG factors in its investment strategy.

      "The provided fund summary Prospectus outlines multiple types of risk associated with the BlackRock Advantage International Fund. Understanding these risks is critical in assessing the level of risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Here are the main types of risks identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Market Risk: Market risk is the risk associated with the possibility that markets, and thus the value of the assets the fund invests in, will decline due to changes in economic trends, market conditions, or events not related to specific issuers. These declines could be sharp and unpredictable.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Selection Risk: Selection risk refers to the risk that the securities selected by the fund's management will underperform relative to the market, relevant indices, or other funds with similar objectives and strategies. This risk is inherent in all actively managed investment portfolios. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk relates to the potential lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives, making it more difficult for the fund to sell or close derivatives positions without incurring losses. This can also make derivatives more challenging to accurately value. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Operational Risk: The use of derivatives and other investment techniques carries operational risks, including documentation issues, settlement issues, systems failures, human error, and inadequate controls. These risks can arise in the normal operations of the fund management processes. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Legal Risk: Legal risk refers to the possibility that insufficient documentation or the lack of capacity/authority of counterparties could affect the legality or enforceability of contract terms. \n",
      "\n",
      "6. Volatility and Correlation Risk: Volatility risk is the risk associated with the tendency of the value of an investment to experience significant fluctuations in a relatively short time. When using derivatives, the values of these instruments may not correlate with the overall securities markets, leading to additional volatility and potential losses. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given these risks, investing in the Fund carries a moderate to high level of risk, depending on an investor's risk tolerance. It is crucial to assess your risk tolerance by considering your financial situation, goals, and comfort with volatility when investing in this, or any other, investment fund.\n"

      "\n",
      "This higher turnover rate signals more active trading and adjustments to the portfolio's composition. It's important to consider this factor in light of the fund's investment strategy and objectives, as higher turnover can lead to distribution of capital gains, affecting an investor's tax obligations. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is important to note that portfolio turnover rates vary across funds and depend on their investment strategies. Some strategies, such as index funds that aim to replicate specific market indices, typically have lower turnover rates because they make fewer trades. Compared to actively managed funds that frequently adjust their portfolios based on market conditions and investment insights, passively managed funds have lower turnover rates. \n",
